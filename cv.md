## Summary
I’m going to start working as a Junior Front-end Developer this year. Want to be in a space where people do huge useful things and make high demands on themselves.

I've graduated from UNIT Factory this year and now I'm studying at École 42 (software engineering school). I have 3+ years of non-commercial experience working with C, C# (Unity), Swift, and JavaScript.

Studying and working on UNIT Factory projects, I've become an extremely stress-resistant developer with the ability to work on tasks of any difficulty, under any circumstances as well as always meeting the deadlines.

## Skills
* JavaScript, Python. C, Swift
* HTML/CSS, SASS, LESS, PUG
* React

## Code example
```console.log("b" + "a" + +"a" + "a");```
